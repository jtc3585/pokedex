Successfully created webPokeDex using React, React-Router, and Styled Components

Pokemon are displayed in aplhabetical order and can be filtered by name using the input box
There are a lot of pokemon and no implemented pagination so filtering can sometimes lag behind the users keystroke, give it time

console is full of resource errors and some syntax warnings, they do not effect the app and are accounted for

The user is brought to a pokemon profile when clicking on any of the cards
clicking on the "project Pokedex" header will bring the user back to the index

I learned a lot from making this and was glad I got to complete it, the concepts of state and sources of truth
were a challenge at times.

# Welcome to Project-PokÃ©dex

### Task

Clone this repo and build an app that can use the 
[PokÃ©mon API](https://pokeapi.co/) to display PokÃ©mon in 
alphabetical order.
You will need to be creative when deciding how to layout the data.
Your app should be able to filter on the criteria of your choosing.
The user should be able to click on a PokÃ©mon for more information.
